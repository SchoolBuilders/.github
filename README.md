# Why?

Learning code has nothing to do with rushing or binging video tutorials. A brain needs time to think differently and find new ways to resolve problems.

# Who?

Anyone can learn code as long as they put time and dedication into it. How they organize their time and their dedication should not be forced upon them by a syllabus or a tight schedule.
